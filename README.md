Welcome, I'm Balint Pekker! ðŸ‘‹
---

I'm a highly competent [Acquia Certified Drupal Developer](https://certification.acquia.com/user/8254) at [Cheppers](https://cheppers.com) focusing on building fast, reliable and secure websites besides learning new areas.

[Contributing to Drupal 10](https://twitter.com/kispeki/status/1603556134232760320) was a great pleasure, just as much as being part of this awesome team!

- :blue_book: I'm currently learning AWS, Vue.js and Drupal and my current goal is to pass the Backend Specialist Exam in the near future.
- :dancers: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new modules/solutions helping developers in their daily routine in any way.
- :briefcase: I'm currently working on a Drupal project with an international team.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about anything related to Symfony or Drupal and I'll try my best to answer.
- :wink: Pronouns: he/him

> I'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Stackoverflow and GitHub for their persistent support in my programming career.

In my free time I like to try out new web development technologies, building small games with Unreal Engine, or refereeing local soccer games on weekends.
